We believe even more people would be willing to help if there was a simple and straightforward way of doing so. This is where the Give-AID app comes in! Sebastian Stricker and Bernhard Kowatsch founded Give-AID in April 2014 in Berlin during a sabbatical. A large number of voluntary supporters were essential to the further development of Give-AID. Give-AID is now an innovation project within WFP. The team is located in Berlin, Germany. We’d love to hear from you – drop us an email at support@sharethemeal.org. You can also find out more about Give-AID at https://sharethemeal.org/.',
